## Usage

### Dependencies

Our server is written in Haskell and is managed using Stack, which can be installed [here](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/). We use [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) as the package manager for our project, which can be installed with the following commands:

```sh
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install maven
```

### Running the Server

With Stack installed and your working directory set to `CI-server/server`, the following commands can be run:

```sh
$ stack test # Run tests
$ stack build # Build the Stack project
$ stack run  # Run the web server (default config file is "./config.yaml")
$ stack run -- <Path to your config file> # Run the web server
```

With Maven installed, the following commands can be run from the root directory:

```sh
$ mvn package # Build the project and run unit tests
$ mvn test # Only run the tests without rebuild
$ mvn exec:java # Run the main function
$ mvn javadoc:javadoc # Generate documentation
```

### Further Dependencies

- Maven 3.6+ requires JDK 8 or above to execute.
- Additional dependencies for Maven are configured in `pom.xml`, while those for Stack are specified in `/server/package.yaml`.

## Coding Standard

We follow [Google's Java Style](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/tree/main/plugin-maven#google-java-format) and enforce the standard via [Spotless](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless). For Haskell, we follow [Fourmolu's Haskell Style](https://fourmolu.github.io/) and enforce the standard via [Fourmolu](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fourmolu).
